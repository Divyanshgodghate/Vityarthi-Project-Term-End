Project Statement: Python CLI Expense Tracker 
Objective 
The primary goal of this project is to provide a simple, robust, and platform-independent command
line interface (CLI) solution for personal financial tracking. It allows users to easily log, view, and 
analyze their daily or monthly expenditures. 
Core Technology 
The application is developed entirely in Python and leverages the standard library modules, including 
csv and datetime, ensuring high portability and minimal dependencies. 
Key Features 
1. Data Persistence: Expenses are stored locally in a machine-readable CSV file (expenses.csv), 
providing a persistent record that can also be easily imported into spreadsheet software for 
deeper analysis. 
2. Transaction Management: Users can quickly add new expenses by providing the date, 
category, amount, and an optional description. 
3. Reporting and Analysis: The application generates a comprehensive summary report that 
displays the total expenditure and provides a categorized financial breakdown, showing the 
percentage contribution of each spending category to the total. 
4. Interface: The application features a clean, menu-driven CLI for easy navigation and 
interaction. 
Target Audience 
This tool is ideal for individuals seeking a straightforward, non-web-based method to maintain an 
accurate ledger of their expenses without relying on complex external software or cloud services.
